# Spring 6 - Basic Web App
> This is not a particularly interesting project, just an introduction of sorts!

This is the first of many projects related to Spring 6 and Spring boot that will be pushed in-time.
The projects are based on **John Thompson**'s UDEMY course "[Spring Framework 6: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-6-beginner-to-guru/learn/)"
